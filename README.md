## Inspiration and Ideation

I use my computer a lot, especially for video editing, and a lot of coding/multitasking. I wanted to make a MacroPad that makes my life easier, helps me copy, paste, cut, undo, redo, all with ease. I use these shortcuts atleast 40 times a day, and having them just a buttons press away would be amazing. I also added a Rotary Encoder to control my volume (for my music), and possibly in the future, to scrub the video editing timeline. The OLED screen would display the current time and some cool graphics (have to work on that in the future through client based code). 

## Challenges
This was not my first time using Fusion, however it was my first time doing PCB design, and I ran into a lot of problems with the footprints, and how to set up vias, but now I can confidently design simple PCBs.
